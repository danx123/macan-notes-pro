## 🆕 Changelog v2.5.0 (2025-08-22)
* Session Restoration: The application now remembers all your open tabs (both saved and unsaved) and restores them automatically the next time you open it.

* Window State Saving: It will remember its last size and position on the screen, so you don't have to resize or move it every time.

* Last Used Directory: The "Open" and "Save As" dialogs will now start in the last folder you used, making file access quicker.

* Single Instance Mode: Opening a file from your file explorer will now open it in a new tab within the already running application, instead of launching a completely new window.
